\title{Filter ASV abundance matrix and convert to taxmap object}
\usage{
asv_matrix_to_taxmap_phyloseq(
  min_read_depth = 0,
  minimum_bootstrap = 0,
  pid_species = 0,
  pid_genus = 0,
  pid_family = 0,
  save_outputs = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{min_read_depth}{Threshold for ASVs to remove if number of
reads is less than this value across all samples-todo check on this}

\item{minimum_bootstrap}{Threshold for bootstrap support value
for taxonomic assignments. Below designated minimum bootstrap
threshold, taxnomoic assignments will be set to N/A.}

\item{pid_species}{If percent identity is below this value, at the species
level, taxonomic assignment will be set to N/A}

\item{pid_genus}{If percent identity is below this value, at the genus
level, taxonomic assignment will be set to N/A}

\item{pid_family}{If percent identity is below this value, at the family
level, taxonomic assignment will be set to N/A}

\item{save_outputs}{Logical, indicating whether to save the taxmap object. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
ASV matrix converted to taxmap object
}
